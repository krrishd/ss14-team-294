<p>The game you see here is a <strong>prototype</strong> of a broader
concept called <a href="http://playelasticity.org/">Elasticity</a></p>

<p>The concept behind Elasticity is to use video games to encourage
people to donate real money to charity. This prototype shows what
such a game might look like, but does not involve donating real money.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>
You start the game off with a certain number of credits, which you
can use to purchase items from the <code>Marketplace</code>. Items
from the Marketplace are designed to accelerate the growth of your
village. The items you buy from the Marketplace work in your village
and give you more credits in return.</p>
<p>
Some of the items in the Marketplace give a better return on investment
than others. Part of the fun is finding the fastest way to make your
city grow.
</p>
<h2>For a Better Cause</h2>
<p>
The items you buy correspond to actual loan categories on <a
href="http://kiva.org">Kiva</a>. When you "buy" virtual items,
the game looks up loans on Kiva that you might be interested in.
</p>
<p>
  When purchasing a product, scroll down past the purchase item until you see the loan button:

<p>
In the future, lending to the developing world would be directly
integrated into the video game.
